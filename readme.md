Sprint1 finished, we have done following:
1. basic pipeline without exception
2. sram store

So based on PA plan, we have to finish these in sprint2(due on Friday, week 10). If you find out something missing, just contact me or append your suggestion below
1. pipeline with exception
2. run on board rather than simulation
3. mem access with exception
4. start preparing for our extension applicaton: some device and so on

I will list more concrete tasks below tomorrow, we'd better get to work soon :
